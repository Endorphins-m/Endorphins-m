This is a repository for software engineering courses I am a student majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology and i am a laughing boy. My hobby is fitness In my freshman and sophomore years, I mastered the basic syntax of C, Java, and Python, but I only had a preliminary understanding, and I felt that I was a rookie in the field of code programming, and I hope to improve after studying software engineering courses. Due to my shallow knowledge, I still don't have a research direction that I particularly like, and I hope that I can find a research direction that I like in my junior year. At present, I should be inclined to go to graduate school, hoping to strengthen my professional knowledge and ability in my junior year, and work hard to prepare for the graduate school entrance examination in my senior year.
